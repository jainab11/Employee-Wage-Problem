# Employee-Wage-Problem
Displaying Welcome Message and Starting Program:

Begin the program with a welcome message indicating it's the Employee Wage Computation program, possibly on the master branch if you're working with version control.
Check Employee Attendance:

Use a random number generator to simulate employee attendance, where 1 might represent present and 0 absent.
UC 1: Calculate Daily Employee Wage:

Assuming the wage per hour is $20 and a full day's work is 8 hours, multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked to calculate the daily wage.
UC 2: Add Part-time Employee & Wage:

Assuming part-time work is also 8 hours, apply the same calculation as for full-time employees but with appropriate adjustments for hours worked.
UC 3: Solving using Switch Case Statement:

Use a switch-case statement to handle different scenarios or calculations based on user input or conditions.
UC 4: Calculating Wages for a Month:

Multiply the daily wage by the number of working days in a month to calculate the monthly wage.
UC 5: Calculate Wages till a Condition of Total Working Hours or Days is Reached for a Month:

Set conditions such as reaching 100 hours of work or 20 days of work, and calculate wages accordingly.
UC 6 & 7: Refactor Code to Write a Class Method to Compute Employee Wage:

Organize your code into classes and methods. Create a class with methods to calculate wages based on different scenarios. Utilize class variables and methods for efficiency and modularity.
UC 8: Compute Employee Wage for Multiple Companies:

Implement a system where each company's wage, number of working days, and hours per month are parameters passed to the computation method.
Using Function Parameters Instead of Class in Python:

In Python, you can achieve similar functionality by defining functions instead of classes. Pass function parameters to handle different company configurations.
